One of the methods that allows the cloud to perform operations on encrypted data without having any information about it, without decrypting it, is Homomorphic Encryption. This type of encryption has been studied from a theoretical point of view without any effective application.
In this  project, I examine Paillierâ€™s encryption and its application to confidentiality while preserving the outsourcing of calculations, which will be useful for many applications. and present a new implementation of the Paillier cryptosystem that will transform it into a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) based on protocols.In the end, we will develop client interfaces, desktop and mobile, using python and Kivy library , which allows customers to not only benefit from cloud services but also to protect their privacy.
